The Cedar Grove Robot Friend FeatherWing passively connects the FeatherWing connections of a PyBadge or PyGamer device with a Crickit FeatherWing. The Crickit provides 3.3V power to the attached PyBadge or PyGamer. All Feather signals are interconnected to accomodate custom alterations to the Crickit module, such as support for IRQ/Busy or sensor modifications.

The Cedar Grove Robot Friend includes a prototype area and a breakout of all Feather pins for further cusomization.

For use ONLY with the Crickit FeatherWing and compatible Feather MCU boards. To date, it has only been tested with the PyGamer and PyBadge. Double-check pin compatibility if you plan to attach or stack other Feather devices.
