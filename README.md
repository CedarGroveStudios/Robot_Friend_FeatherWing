For perching on the top of a robot chassis, the Cedar Grove Robot Friend FeatherWing passively connects the FeatherWing connections of a PyBadge or PyGamer device with a Crickit FeatherWing. The Crickit provides 3.3V power to the attached PyBadge or PyGamer. All Feather signals are interconnected to accommodate custom alterations to the Crickit module, such as support for IRQ/Busy or sensor modifications.

The Cedar Grove Robot Friend includes a prototype area and a breakout of all Feather pins for further cusomization.

For use ONLY with the Crickit FeatherWing and compatible Feather MCU boards. To date, it has only been tested with the PyGamer and PyBadge. Double-check pin compatibility if you plan to attach or stack other Feather devices.

Caution: The Crickit FeatherWing is capable of providing up to 150mA of 3.3-volt power to the attached PyBadge/PyGamer Feather. In normal operation without any of the NeoPixels lighted, the PyBadge/PyGamer will draw about 60mA from the Crickit's internal 3.3-volt regulator. If you need to brightly light the PyBadge/PyGamer NeoPixels, consider adding a small LiPo battery directly to the PyBadge/PyGamer or just use the Crickit's internal NeoPixel (seesaw pin #27).
